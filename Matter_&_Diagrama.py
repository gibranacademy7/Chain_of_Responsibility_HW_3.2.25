# To check if a number between 10 and 100 is prime, perform the following checks:
#
# Check if the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder. If yes, print "The number is not prime." Otherwise, continue.
# Check if the number is divisible by 3 without a remainder. If yes, print "The number is not prime." Otherwise, continue.
# Check if the number is divisible by 5 without a remainder. If yes, print "The number is not prime." Otherwise, continue.
# Check if the number is divisible by 7 without a remainder. If yes, print "The number is not prime." Otherwise, print "The number is prime."
# Test the above logic for the numbers: 12, 17, 23, 100, 121.
#
# Additionally, add a check to verify whether the number is within the range of 10 to 100.
#
# If the number is within the range, proceed to the next step.
# Otherwise, print "The number is out of range" and exit.
# Place this range check before the division check by 2 in the sequence.
#
# Finally, test the program for the numbers: 121, 169.
